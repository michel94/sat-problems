1. Install an SMT solver (e.g. z3, Yices).
Z3: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases
Yices: http://yices.csl.sri.com/

The binaries of Z3 are available to several architectures.

The next exercises should be solved using SMT-LIB v2 language.

2. Consider the houses puzzle (lecture 03).
   a) Encode the problem into SMT
   b) Run the SMT solver to get a solution assignment.

3. Consider the sudoku puzzle 4 x 4.
   a) Consider a specific instance and encode it into SMT using QF_UF.
   b) Run a SMT solver to get a solution assignment.
   c) Expand the SMT2 file to solve more than one sudoku instance.
   c) Encode the same instance into SMT using QF_LIA
   d) Run a SMT solver to get a solution assignment.
