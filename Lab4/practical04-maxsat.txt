1. Install a MaxSAT solver (e.g. 
   open-wbo http://sat.inesc-id.pt/open-wbo/, 
   mscg http://logos.ucd.ie/web/doku.php?id=mscg).

2. Encode the following problems into MaxSAT taking 
into account the slides of lecture 6. Run a MaxSAT solver 
to solve the specific examples given in the slides.

a) minimum vertex cover (page 14)

b) maximum clique (page 16)

c) maximum independent set (page 16)

d) design debugging (page 20)

e) software upgradability problem (page 21)

3. Consider the CP12 paper "Reasoning over Biological 
Networks Using Maximum Satisfiability" available from 
http://sat.inesc-id.pt/~jguerra/rbnms/ 
Encode the example in Figure 1 into MaxSAT. Obtain all
the solutions for the different kinds of repairs (section 3.2).
